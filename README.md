## **Basic Linux Setup and Virtualization**

### **Overview**  
- Set up Linux systems using **Vagrant** and **VirtualBox**.
- Create multiple VMs with private networks to simulate a lab environment.

### **Steps**
1. **Install VirtualBox and Vagrant** on your machine.
2. **Create a VM with Vagrant:**
   ```bash
   mkdir linux-lab
   cd linux-lab
   vagrant init ubuntu/bionic64
   vagrant up
   vagrant ssh
   ```
3. **Test VM Management Commands**
```bash
   vagrant halt
   vagrant up
   vagrant destroy
```
4. **Configure a Private Network Between VMs**
   - **Assign static IPs and SSH between them.**

 ## **LAMP Stack Deployment**

### **Overview**  
   - Install and configure the **LAMP stack** to host web applications.

### **Steps:**

**1. Install Apache:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
```
**2. Install PHP and MariaDB:**
